<h1>Final Year Project</h1>

<h2>Development of Blockchain-Based Security Sharing Scheme for Research and Medical Data with Fine-Grained Access Control</h2>

<p>
This project presents the design and implementation of a blockchain-based framework for secure sharing of medical and research data among hospitals, doctors, and researchers. The system employs smart contracts to enforce fine-grained access control, ensuring that sensitive data is accessed only by authorized parties. Performance evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed solution in terms of efficiency, security, and scalability, making it suitable for real-world healthcare and research environments.
